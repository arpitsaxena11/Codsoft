A landing page project is a single web page designed with a specific goal in mind, often to capture leads, promote a product, or drive a particular action from visitors. Its purpose is to focus users' attention on a singular objective, making it a crucial tool for marketing campaigns, product launches, or special offers.

Key features typically include:

1. **Compelling Headline**: A clear, attention-grabbing statement that conveys the main benefit or value proposition.
2. **Call to Action (CTA)**: Prominent buttons or links encouraging visitors to take the desired action, such as signing up, purchasing, or downloading.
3. **Brief, Persuasive Copy**: Concise and engaging text that highlights key benefits and addresses visitor pain points or interests.
4. **Visual Elements**: High-quality images, videos, or graphics that support the message and create a visually appealing experience.
5. **Lead Capture Form**: An integrated form for collecting visitor information, such as email addresses, to build a contact list or follow up with leads.

Project 3: [Calculator]
Description:
A calculator project using HTML and CSS is a web-based tool designed to perform basic arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Its purpose is to provide users with a functional, interactive interface for performing calculations directly in their web browsers.

Key features typically include:

1. **User Interface**: A clean and intuitive layout with buttons for digits (0-9) and operations (+, -, *, /), along with a display area for showing input and results.
2. **Basic Functionality**: Ability to perform fundamental arithmetic operations and display results accurately.
3. **Responsive Design**: A layout that adjusts to different screen sizes and devices, ensuring usability on desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
4. **Styling**: Custom CSS for visually appealing design elements, such as button colors, fonts, and spacing, creating a user-friendly and engaging experience.
5. **Error Handling**: Basic error handling, such as preventing invalid operations (e.g., dividing by zero) and ensuring clear, understandable feedback for users.

This project typically focuses on creating a seamless and interactive user experience through a combination of HTML for structure and CSS for styling, with the potential for adding JavaScript to handle the logic and functionality behind the calculations.
